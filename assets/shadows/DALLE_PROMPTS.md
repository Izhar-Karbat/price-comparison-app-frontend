# DALL-E Prompts for Claymorphism Shadow Images

Generate these images at 1024x1024px, then resize as needed.

## 1. Raised Card Shadow (clay-raised-medium.png)

**Prompt:**
```
Create a soft 3D claymorphism style card background on a light cream #F7F5F3 background. The card should have:
- Rounded corners (radius 20px)
- Soft white/light shadow on the top-left (as if light is coming from top-left)
- Soft dark gray shadow on the bottom-right
- The card itself should be the same cream color #F7F5F3
- Subtle gradient from lighter top-left to slightly darker bottom-right
- No text or icons, just the pure 3D card shape with shadows
- Make it look like soft clay or plasticine material
- Image should be perfectly centered with padding for shadows
```

## 2. Pressed/Inset Card Shadow (clay-pressed-medium.png)

**Prompt:**
```
Create an inset/pressed claymorphism style card background on a light cream #F7F5F3 background. The card should appear pressed into the surface with:
- Rounded corners (radius 20px)
- Dark shadow on the top-left (inside the depression)
- Light highlight on the bottom-right edge
- The pressed area should be slightly darker than the background
- Subtle inset effect like a button that's been pressed
- No text or icons, just the pure pressed shape
- Make it look like soft clay pressed inward
- Image should be perfectly centered
```

## 3. Circular Button Raised (clay-circle-raised.png)

**Prompt:**
```
Create a circular claymorphism button on a light cream #F7F5F3 background:
- Perfect circle shape
- Soft white highlight on top-left suggesting elevation
- Soft gray shadow on bottom-right
- The button appears to float above the surface
- Subtle 3D effect like a clay bubble
- No text or icons
- Soft, organic feel like molded clay
```

## 4. Tab Button Active (clay-tab-active.png)

**Prompt:**
```
Create a pill-shaped claymorphism tab button in sage green #8FBF9F:
- Rounded rectangle/pill shape
- Appears raised from the surface
- Soft shadows suggesting elevation
- The button is filled with sage green color
- White soft highlight on top-left edge
- Darker green shadow on bottom-right
- No text, just the shape
```

## 5. Large Feature Card (clay-raised-large.png)

**Prompt:**
```
Create a large rectangular claymorphism card on cream #F7F5F3 background:
- Large rounded rectangle (aspect ratio 2:1)
- Prominent soft shadows for depth
- Multiple shadow layers for extra 3D effect
- Soft white rim light on top and left edges
- Deeper shadow on bottom and right
- Very subtle and organic, like molded clay
- Extra padding around edges for shadow space
```

## Tips for DALL-E:
- Ask for "transparent PNG" if you want transparency around the shadows
- Specify "high contrast shadows" if they're too subtle
- Add "minimalist, clean design" to avoid unwanted details
- Use "flat color, no texture" if you want pure colors without gradients

## After Generation:
1. Download as PNG files
2. Resize to multiple sizes (small: 240x120, medium: 400x200, large: 640x320)
3. Optimize with tools like TinyPNG
4. Place in assets/shadows/ directory
