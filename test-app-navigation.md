# PharmMate Navigation Test Results

## AppContext Implementation Status ✅

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ **Updated AppContext.tsx**
   - Properly manages onboarding state with `hasOnboarded` flag
   - Uses AsyncStorage with key `@onboardingCompleted`
   - Provides `completeOnboarding()` function
   - Includes loading state management

2. ✅ **Modified App.tsx**
   - Wrapped app in proper provider hierarchy: AppProvider > AuthProvider > CartProvider
   - Created `AppContent` component that uses `useApp()` hook
   - Shows loading spinner while checking onboarding status
   - Conditionally renders OnboardingNavigator or MainAppNavigator based on `hasOnboarded`

3. ✅ **Fixed Navigation Types**
   - Added `OnboardingStackParamList` type definition
   - Updated navigation types to include VisualSearch and PriceComparison screens
   - Fixed onboarding screen navigation props

4. ✅ **Updated Onboarding Screens**
   - WelcomeScreen uses correct navigation type
   - PreferencesScreen uses correct navigation type
   - NotificationsScreen already integrated with `completeOnboarding()`

## Testing Instructions:

### First Launch (New User):
1. Clear app data or AsyncStorage
2. Launch app
3. Should see Welcome screen
4. Navigate: Welcome → Preferences → Notifications
5. Tap "Enable Notifications" or "Maybe Later"
6. Should transition to MainApp (Home screen)

### Subsequent Launches (Returning User):
1. Launch app
2. Should skip onboarding and go directly to Home screen

### Reset Onboarding:
To test onboarding flow again:
```javascript
// Add this temporary button to a settings screen:
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const resetOnboarding = async () => {
  await AsyncStorage.removeItem('@onboardingCompleted');
  // Restart app
};
```

## Key Files Modified:
- `/context/AppContext.tsx` - Core state management
- `/App.tsx` - Root navigation logic
- `/navigation/types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/navigation/OnboardingNavigator.tsx` - Onboarding stack navigator
- `/screens/onboarding/WelcomeScreen.tsx` - Fixed navigation types
- `/screens/onboarding/PreferencesScreen.tsx` - Fixed navigation types
- `/screens/onboarding/NotificationsScreen.tsx` - Already integrated

## Navigation Flow:
```
App Launch
    ↓
AppProvider (loads onboarding status)
    ↓
Loading Spinner
    ↓
hasOnboarded?
    ├─ No → OnboardingNavigator
    │       ├─ WelcomeScreen
    │       ├─ PreferencesScreen
    │       └─ NotificationsScreen → completeOnboarding()
    │
    └─ Yes → MainAppNavigator
            ├─ HomeScreen (Tab)
            ├─ CartScreen (Tab)
            └─ AccountScreen (Tab)
```

## Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

The AppContext has been successfully implemented and integrated. The navigation should now be stable, with proper persistence of onboarding status and smooth transitions between screens.
